## Vanilla biomes changes
Although Terralith already overhauls the terrain greatly, it also modifies some vanilla biomes slightly to make them more alive and thrive among other similar biomes. The changes may vary from the addition of some blocks or changing the shape of a tree to completely new features and or terrain shapes.

## Minor changes
Plain and open biomes got some changes to make them feel more alive. Plains biomes, for example, have more grass and tall grass, with some random but rare patches of coarse dirt. The Vanilla Savanna biome also now has rare stripes of dirt paths going through it, as if wildlife lived there and have left trails behind them.

Some minor changes to Vanilla biomes include trees. Terralith changes trees in Taiga biomes, Swamp biomes, and also in the Dark Forest biome, which now has taller trees, making it easier to navigate, with some glow lichen, making it less dangerous but more mysterious.

## Major changes
Despite tweaking some detail in some biomes, Terralith adds new shapes into the terrain, but without forgetting the Vanilla biomes.

Mountains can now be more spectacular with Terralith, sometimes sharp, amplified, or soft like Vanilla, but they can also be taller than before by being able to reach Y290, Y256 being the maximum value a player could reach on a Vanilla world.

To smooth out the sharper terrain, Terralith makes use of slabs and layered snow where it can to make the landscape more pleasant.

Cliffs biomes can now generate as beautiful Overhangs, making seasides more imposing, Desert biomes are now made of Dunes, making the landscape realistic and smooth, you can also come across Arches in Mesas and finally, you can sometimes stumble upon Mega caves when mining underground.

Oceans have been overhauled, not with new blocks or biomes, but with deeper and more detailed terrain, making the deep end of the ocean look equally frightening as it is beautiful.

## Ores
Terralith does not modify the ore distribution in Vanilla biomes, and only changes the material of the ore in some case, turning it in deepslate ore if dark material can be found around it, and raises the appearance of some ores in specific Terralith biomes. For example, Emerald peaks appear with more Emerald Ores, Scarlet mountains spawn with more Redstone Ores, and Volcanic crater spawn with more Diamond Ores.

## Features
Terralith adds and uses WorldGen features to make your world more unique.

### Mega ravines
Mega ravines are WorldGen features found in Terralith and Terralith Legacy. Unlike Vanilla ravines, they extend downward, sometimes reaching the Bedrock. Although excellent for mining, they can be deadly if you happen to fall in one.

### Mega geodes
Mega geodes are Worldgen features added by version 2.0.2 of Terralith. Bigger than classic, Vanilla geodes, those geodes are 2 to 3 times larger and unlike Vanilla ones, they cannot appear connected to a cave, meaning the only way to find them is through strip-mining.

### Andesite boulders
Andesite boulders are WorldGen features added to Terralith in version 2.0.10. They indicate Andesite caves underneath the surface, just like Vanilla Azalea trees indicate lush caves.

### Granite pillars
Granite pillars are WorldGen features added to Terralith in version 2.0.10. Functioning like Azalea trees indicate a Lush cave, they indicate that Granite caves can be found underneath.

Diorite patches are WorldGen features added to Terralith in version 2.0.10. They indicate Diorite caves underneath the surface, just like Vanilla Azalea trees indicate lush caves.
